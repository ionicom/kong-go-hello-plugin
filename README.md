# kong-go-hello-plugin

Build the plugin binary (`go-hello`):
```console

```

Test the plugin binary:
```console
./go-hello --help
Usage of ./go-hello:

    	Dump info about plugins
  -help
    	Show usage info
  -kong-prefix string
    	Kong prefix path (specified by the -p argument commonly used in the kong cli) (default "/usr/local/kong")
```

Run Kong with docker-compose which runs the docker image defined in Dockerfile
which packages the plugin.
